Source code management(SCM) is synonymous with version control, It is a software tool that programmers use to manage the source code. It tracks the modifications to a source code repository and help deal with merge conflicts

Advantages of source code management
 - Track changes over time by creating a historical record.
 - to compare the older versions and even undo some changes to the code base
 
Importance of Source Code Management

- Track changes
- Synchronization
- Backup and Restore
- Undoing
- Branching and Merging
- Identifying conflicts and preventing overwrites

Version control is the management of changes of documents, computer programs, large websites and any other collection of information

Two types 

CVCS - CVCS uses a central server to store all files and enables team collabration

Drawbacks:
1. It is not available locally, you always need to be connected to a network to perform any action
2. Since everything is centralized , in any case of the central server getting crashed or corrupted will result in losing the entire data of the project

DVCS - They don't rely on a central server to store all the versions of a project file

In distribute version control systems every contributor has a local copy or "Clone" of the main repository i.e everyone maintains a local repository of their own which contains all the files and metadata present in the main repository
